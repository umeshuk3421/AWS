1) what is cloud computing ?
-> Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet.

2)deployment model in cloud ?
-> there are 4 types of deployment model 
	a)Public Cloud
	b)Private Cloud
	c)Hybrid Cloud
	d)Community Cloud


Advantages of the Public Cloud Model:-Minimal Investment( pay-per-use service), No setup cost,Infrastructure Management is not required.

Disadvantages of the Public Cloud Model:- Less secure ,Low customization 


Advantages of the Private Cloud Model:- Data Security and Privacy(only authorized staff have access)

Disadvantages of the Private Cloud Model:-Costly: Private clouds are more costly as they provide personalized facilities.


Advantages of the Hybrid Cloud Model:- it is addition is privet cloud & public cloude.
Security: Because data is properly separated, the chances of data theft by attackers are considerably reduced. 

Disadvantages of the Hybrid Cloud Model:- Difficult to manage: Hybrid clouds are difficult to manage as it is a combination of both public and private cloud. So, it is complex.


Advantages of the Community Cloud Model:- Security: Community cloud provides better security.Shared resources: It allows you to share resources, infrastructure, etc. with multiple organizations.
Collaboration and data sharing: It is suitable for both collaboration and data sharing.



3) services model in cloud?
->There are the following three types of cloud service models -

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Software as a Service (SaaS)


4)architecture of cloud computing ?

front end -> client infrastructure 
           |

	   |
back end ->appllication,storage,service,security.



5)aws global infrastructure count for cloud computing?
-> AWS Global Infrastructure Map. The AWS Cloud spans 102 Availability Zones within 32 geographic regions around the world, with announced plans for 12 more Availability Zones and 4 more AWS Regions.

6)why do we use regions in cloud computing?
->  This reduces latency and cost. Choosing a region farther away from you would lead to high latency of service delivery and high cost.

7)what is service ? what are resources ?
->  individual users or groups of users—known as service crews—who can perform field service work. Create service resources so you can assign service appointments to them.
